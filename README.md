Node, express, ember and mongoose boilerplate

This is a very simple little boilerplate with an express auth api (Beaerer stragegy), and client side auth.

## Get Going

    npm install mongodb
    
then, in another tab

    mongod

then:

    npm install grunt
    
and, in the project dir:

    grunt
    
open the browser and: lvh.me:3000
